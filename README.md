# WarpedDrive
A virus-fighting game set on a spaceship in the future

##Aboard the _Adnascentia_
You begin Warped Drive as a network engineer aboard a slower-than-light Wormway Construction starship headed for a star lightyears from Earth.  The year is 2287, and the United Nation's Exosolar Colonial Authority is establishing wormholes to far-flung worlds. Rudely awakened from cryosleep, you find a virulent computer virus has thoroughly infected the starship's entire network.  It is up to you and your antivirus and networking know-how to purge the system and ensure the safety of yourself and the crew.

##Breathe slowly
Your primary concern is the lack of life support. The virus has disabled it in order to reroute power to other systems. You only have minutes to enter cyberspace and clean machine by machine.  You cobble together some oxygen generators, but they can't keep up. Use up all your oxygen in storage before you get back to your cryopod and you're dead.  Spend time in cryosleep to gain precious O2, but stay asleep too long and the virus will re-infect machines with a vengence.

##Liberate the System
Traverse the entire starship's network on your quest to free the Engineering, Archive, and Bridge subnets.  Unlock magnetic seals in cyberspace to access the contents of cargo bays - if you're lucky you'll find some O2 canisters. Bypass airgaps by sneakernet, getting you access to non-networked locations. Do all this while upgrading your virus-fighting subroutines as you see fit.

Can you clean the system before it's too late? Will you find how your starship came to be infected? Will your crewmates die slowly in their pods?
